Architectural Kata – practice challenges

# ✅ Tips for Learning System Design
Focus on trade-offs, not just “perfect” solutions

Build & sketch systems you use daily (Instagram, WhatsApp)

Learn about networking basics (DNS, HTTP, TCP)

Practice explaining your design out loud or on a whiteboard

Read real-world architecture case studies (e.g., Uber, Netflix)
